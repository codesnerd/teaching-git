Assuming you all are using Windows 10.

# Get Started

1. Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Create a GitHub account, if you don't have one already.

# Configure Git

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
```
git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
```

GitHub recently changed the default branch on new repositories from master to main, change the default branch for Git using this command:

```
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

To verify things are working properly, enter these commands and verify that the output matches your name and email address:

```
git config --get user.name
```
```
git config --get user.email
```

# What's Next?

These are just basic and beginner resources. If you done the above mentioned work well enough, you are ready to dive deep into the concepts AND also learn some other VERY important concepts:

1. Cloning a repo
2. Forking a repo 
3. Difference between cloning and forking
4. Branches
5. Merge Conflicts
6. Pull Requests (Although we will work as collaborators instead of contributors but PR is an important concept to learn.)

Without learning these concepts, it would be extremely hard for us to work smoothly on our FYP.
