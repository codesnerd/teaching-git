# Branches

Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The master branch is the "default" branch when you create a repository. Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch upon completion.

A **branch** could be interpreted as an individual timeline of our project commits.

With Git, we can create many of these alternative environments (i.e. we can create different **branches**) so other versions of our project code can exist and be tracked in parallel.

That allows us to add new (experimental, unfinished, and potentially buggy) features in separate branches, without touching the '_official'_ stable version of our project code (which is usually kept on the **master** branch).

When we initialize a repository and start making commits, they are saved to the **master** branch by default.

## Creating a new branch

You can create a new branch using the following command:

```bash
git branch <new-branch-name>
```

The new branch that gets created will be the reference to the current state of your repository.

\
üìå It's a good idea to create a **development** branch where you can work on improving your code, adding new experimental features, and similar. After development and testing these new features to make sure they don't have any bugs and that they can be used, you can merge them to the master branch.

## Changing branches

To switch to a different branch, you use the **git checkout** command:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

With that, you switch to a different isolated timeline of your project by changing branches.

\
üìå For example, you could be working on different features in your code and have a separate branch for each feature. When you switch to a branch, you can commit code changes which only affect that particular branch. Then, you can switch to another branch to work on a different feature, which won't be affected by the changes and commits made from the previous branch.

To create a new branch and change to it at the same time, you can use the **-b** flag:

```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è To list the branches for your project, use this command: `git branch`

To go back to the **master** branch, use this command:

## Merging branches

You can merge branches in situations where you want to implement the code changes that you made in an individual branch to a different branch.

For example, after you fully implemented and tested a new feature in your code, you would want to merge those changes to the stable branch of your project (which is usually the default **master** branch).

To merge the changes from a different branch into your current branch, you can use this command:

```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```

You would replace `<branch-name>` with the branch that you want to integrate into your current branch.

## Deleting a branch

To delete a branch, you can run the **git branch** command with the **-d** flag:

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```
